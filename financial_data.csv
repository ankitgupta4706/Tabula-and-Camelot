In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our.employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified.personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain,.and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business..We also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure.to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our.business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase.our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce..We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our.operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived.negatively and harm our business and reputation."," The company relies on key personnel, including the President and CEO.
