Paragraph-1:,"Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition,
and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services,
electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater
resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer
geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure,
fulfillment, and marketing.Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as
our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our
business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices
continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser
known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose
business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits."Paragraph-2:,"We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,
which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by,
service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we
may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the
benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In
addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of 6 reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could
harm our business or damage our reputation."
