SpaCy's named entity recognition (NER) tagger is trained using a supervised learning approach. The training data consists of a large corpus of text, annotated with named entities. The annotated data is used to train a statistical model that can recognize named entities in new, unseen text.

Here are the steps involved in training a SpaCy NER tagger:

Gather and annotate training data: The first step is to gather a large corpus of text that covers the domain and types of named entities that the tagger will need to recognize. This corpus is then annotated with named entities, which involves manually labeling each entity in the text with its corresponding entity type (e.g., person, organization, location, etc.).

Create a feature extractor: SpaCy uses a statistical model to predict named entities, and this model requires a set of features to make these predictions. A feature extractor is used to extract relevant features from the input text, such as the context of the word, its part of speech, and its neighboring words.

Train the model: Once the training data and feature extractor are ready, the model is trained using the annotated corpus. During training, the model learns to associate specific features of the input text with the corresponding named entity labels. The training process involves iteratively updating the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted entity labels and the true labels in the annotated data.

Evaluate the model: After training, the model is evaluated on a held-out dataset to measure its performance in recognizing named entities. The evaluation metrics used can vary, but commonly include precision, recall, and F1-score.

Iteratively improve the model: The model can be further improved by repeating the above steps with additional training data, modifying the feature extractor, or adjusting the training parameters.

Once the NER tagger is trained, it can be used to recognize named entities in new, unseen text. SpaCy's NER tagger has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and is widely used in industry and research.
